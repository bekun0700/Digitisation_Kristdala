This is a work in progress adaptable template repository designed to help students in the University of BorÃ¥s' Digitizing Cultural Herirate Materials course to develop their own website for presenting their digitisation projects, hosted on GitHub. A more elaborate example can be found in Wout's [DIY-frankensTEIn](https://woutdln.github.io/DIY-frankensTEIn/index.html) repository.
